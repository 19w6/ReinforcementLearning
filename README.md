## Reinforcement Learning

The notes so far included **Bandit Algorithms**, **MDP**, **Model-free Methods**, **Value Function Approximation**, **Policy Optimization**.

Moving on entails a lot works on reading. Due to courses final and projects, I will have to leave it at that. However, any advice will be appreciated.
